#Music App

##Idea:
Live chat based music sharing app where users share music and can create playlists. The playlists are saved into a database and users can upvote/downvote songs, which will reflect in their saved playlists . Upcoming song is determined by majority of vote. Recent songs (5?) are displayed to the right of main content. If a song has multiple downvotes it will be skipped and removed from queue. Users can choose to join rooms based on specific genre. If no current songs is in the queue then a random song from the top 10 will be played. Ability to follow users/playlists. Incorporate news feed of friends to see their recent activity.

##Stack:
Ruby, Rails, React, Redux, PostgreSQL, socket.io, Spotify API, Soundcloud API, JavaScript, jQuery, HTML, CSS

+ Gesture based login system - Freeform gestures allowed along with combination of keypress.
